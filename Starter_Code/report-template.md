# Module 12 - Logistic Regression 

## Project Overview

Useing a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, this is a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  *Logistic Regression model with an Accuracy score of 99%, Precission of 100%(0) and 85%(1), and Recall of 99%(0) and 91%(1). 



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  *Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data: Accuracy score of 99%, Precission of 100%(0) and 84%(1), and Recall of 99% for both 0 and 1. 

## Summary

Although both models produce similar results, model 2 (using Resampled Training Data) edges out model 1 with higher Recall for the high-risk loans(1) and model 2 produced fewer false positives and fewer false negatives making model 2 as accurate as model 1 with more reliable data.
